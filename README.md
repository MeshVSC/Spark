## Deployment

### Current Status
- **GitHub Pages**: Active deployment for testing login issues
- **Vercel**: Temporarily disabled (workflow renamed to `deploy.yml.disabled`)

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The app is currently deployed via GitHub Pages to isolate and test login functionality issues that were occurring with Vercel deployment.

**Live URL**: https://meshvsc.github.io/Spark

### Vercel Deployment (Disabled)
The Vercel deployment workflow has been temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts while testing GitHub Pages deployment. To re-enable Vercel deployment:

1. Rename `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled` back to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Disable or remove the GitHub Pages workflow
3. Ensure Vercel environment variables are properly configured

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Real-time subscriptions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Custom CSS Variables
- **Icons**: Custom SVG icons, Heroicons
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Vercel
- **Development**: ESLint, TypeScript strict mode

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/meshvsc/Spark.git
cd Spark

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Used by `add-mockup-data.js` (usually same as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Used by `add-mockup-data.js` (usually same as `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)

These are configured in:
- **Local development**: `.env.local` file
- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub repository secrets
- **Vercel**: Vercel project environment variables

## üì¶ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript checks
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Create an Area**: Start by creating life areas (Work, Personal, etc.)
2. **Add Projects**: Group related tasks under projects within areas
3. **Create Tasks**: Add individual tasks with due dates, notes, and tags
4. **Track Progress**: Watch progress circles fill as you complete tasks
5. **Stay Organized**: Use Today view for daily planning, Inbox for new items

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + N`: New task
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N`: Quick entry
- `Ctrl/Cmd + K`: Search
- `Ctrl/Cmd + R`: New recurring task
- `Escape`: Close modals

### Tips & Tricks
- Use natural language for dates: "tomorrow", "next week", "friday"
- Subtasks automatically show completion counts (e.g., "2 of 5")
- Progress circles show real-time completion status
- Drag and drop to reorganize tasks and projects
- Use tags to create cross-cutting views of your tasks
